In this project, you will used C++ to code up a simple game I have invented.
The purpose of the project is to practice using classes and objects.
The game consists of `players`. Multiple players can be grouped into `teams`
and two `teams` can play each other. You can make the coding easier by starting
by building and testing `player` before moving on to `team` and then `competition`.

Each PLAYER has:
    - a name
    - an ability level (0, 1, or 2)
    - a player status (0: normal ; 1: captain)
    - a score

Each TEAM has:
    - a name
    - a group of players
    - a total team score
    - exactly one captain

Whenever a player has a turn, they get a random score:
    - ability level 0: score is equally likely to be 0, 1, 2, or 3
    - ability level 1: score is equally likely to be 2, 3, 4, or 5
    - ability level 2: score is equally likely to be 4, 5, 6, or 7
    
Whenever a TEAM has a turn
    - every "normal" player on the team gets a turn
    - the captain gets two turns

A competition goes as follows:
    - players are created
    - two teams are created
    - a draft is conducted in which each team picks players
    - the competition has 5 rounds
        - during each round, each team gets a turn (see above)
    - at the end, team with the highest score wins

You should write the classes for player and team so that all three test cases work.
For best results, start small. Get "player" to work, then team, then the game.
Likewise, for "player", start with the constructor and then work up from three
Test as you go.

Notes: 
    The code for generating the random score values has been written for you.
    The header is in $SHARE/include/ece_3822.h - you don't need to make any edits
    The compiled library containing the random score generator is in $SHARE/include/libece_3822.a
    Simply use the provided Makefile and your code will automatically 'know' what that the
    `int generate_score(int)` function is all about.

    Feel free to add other helper functions or features or whatever if that helps.

    The "vector" data type in C++ can be very helpful here

    Use the submit file to submit, as usual:
    cd ~/dir/with/project/code
    ./submit.py

    The only files that "submit.py" will turn in are the Makefile, play_game.cpp, teamp.cpp, and player.cpp
